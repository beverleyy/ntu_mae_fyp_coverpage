TeX cover page template for NTU MAE FYP report. 

[Also available on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ntu-mae-fyp-cover-page-template/bnptzmwkftmf)

## Important
**This is NOT an official template.** I made this for my FYP report and friends requested it, so here it is

Please check the FYP template whether it has updated or not.

## How to use

The `main.tex` is a good starting point, you can use it as a base to type your own report if you'd like. Feel free to add packages and others in the preamble.

To add sections, create a new `the_file.tex` file and use `\include{the_file.tex}` to add it to the report.

I recommend [Karn's CNYSP report template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ntu-cnysp-research-report-template-cy1400-slash-cy2001-slash-cy2002/hbrtrfvytmtc) if you want something preformatted and easy to use.

## If you don't know any LaTeX

You can either [learn how to use it](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) (Google is your best friend, and the TeX StackExchange), or you could simply fill in the template (Just change the information in `CoverPage.tex` and `TitlePage.tex`), then download the PDF and merge it with a PDF of your report.
